Voice Changer 2
By Nathan Suon

IOS app I made guided through Udacity.  First attempt at learning storyboard and linking together all
the elements to create an actual app.  Off the top of my head, main things were
- Storyboarding
- Segue
- Icons
- Importing frameworks

Had to import AVFoundations framework, started me off reading the documentation and actually having to figure out
how to import frameworks then use them.
